## 🎯 Core Features Implemented

### Deduplication Logic
- ✅ One evaluation per (placement × type)

- ✅ Visual "Saving..." indicator
- ✅ Last saved timestamp display
- ✅ Dirty state tracking

### Multi-Page Form
- ✅ Schema-driven page rendering
- ✅ Progress bar with percentage
- ✅ Page indicators (dots)
- ✅ Next/Previous navigation

## 🔧 Configuration

### Autosave Timing
```typescript
// src/config/evaluation.config.ts
AUTOSAVE_MS: 15000  // Change to desired milliseconds
```

### Badge Text
```typescript
BADGE_TEXT: {
  student: {
    MIDTERM: 'Mid Self',  // Customize
    FINAL: 'Final Self',
  },
  supervisor: {
    MIDTERM: 'Mid Eval',
    FINAL: 'Final Eval',
  },
}
```

### Schema Changes
Edit `src/config/evaluations.schema.json` to:
- Add/remove competencies
- Change rating scales
- Modify field labels
- Add/remove pages
- Change required fields

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Integration Points

1. **Add to Faculty Dashboard:**
```tsx
import { EvaluationSendButtons } from '@/components/faculty/EvaluationSendButtons'

// In faculty dashboard:
<EvaluationSendButtons />
```

2. **Add Badges to Student Views:**
```tsx
import { StudentEvaluationBadges } from '@/components/faculty/StudentEvaluationBadges'

// In student list/card:
<StudentEvaluationBadges 
  placementId={placement.id} 
  studentId={student.id} 
/>
```

3. **Add Badges to Supervisor Views:**
```tsx
import { SupervisorEvaluationBadges } from '@/components/faculty/SupervisorEvaluationBadges'

// In supervisor list/card:
<SupervisorEvaluationBadges 
  placementId={placement.id} 
  supervisorId={supervisor.id} 
/>
```

### Testing (TODO)

1. **Unit Tests** - Create tests for:
   - Deduplication logic
   - Permission checks
   - Validation logic
   - Answer merging
   - Lock/unlock operations

2. **E2E Tests** - Create tests for:
   - Faculty send flow
   - Student completion flow
   - Supervisor completion flow
   - Auto-save functionality
   - Lock confirmation
   - Badge display

### Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run full migration on production database
- [ ] Verify Prisma client generation
- [ ] Test with real placements
- [ ] Verify email notifications (if configured)
- [ ] Test permissions with all user roles
- [ ] Verify auto-save intervals
- [ ] Test print/PDF functionality
- [ ] Review audit logs
- [ ] Test admin unlock feature
- [ ] Verify badge display on all screen sizes

## 📝 Notes

- Schema uses **numeric values** for options (0-3, 9 for N/A) for compact storage
- **Labels** are stored in schema JSON for easy updates without DB changes
- Answers stored as **JSON string** in SQLite (Prisma doesn't support native JSON in SQLite)
- **Placement must be ACTIVE** to receive evaluations
- **No duplicate submissions**: System reuses open submissions
- **Faculty notified** when evaluations are completed
- **Audit trail** captures all evaluation actions with IP addresses
