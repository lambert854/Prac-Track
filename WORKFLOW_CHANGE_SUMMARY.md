## üéØ How This Helps You

### Before Changes
- **Understand the current system completely** - No more guessing how things work
- **Identify dependencies** - Know what will be affected by your changes
- **Plan systematically** - Use the template to ensure you don't miss anything

### During Changes
- **Feature flags** - Toggle between old and new workflows safely
- **Parallel implementation** - Keep old code working while building new
- **Comprehensive testing** - Catch issues before they reach production

### After Changes
- **Safe deployment** - Gradual rollout strategy (10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%)
- **Quick rollback** - Documented procedure if issues arise
- **Complete testing** - Nothing breaks because you tested everything

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Today/Tomorrow):

1. **Read the documentation**
   - Start with: `docs/README.md` (15 min)
   - Then read: `docs/CURRENT_WORKFLOWS.md` sections relevant to your changes (30 min)
   - Quick ref: `docs/QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` (15 min)

2. **Meet with faculty to clarify requirements**
   - What specifically needs to change?
   - Why is the current workflow problematic?
   - What's the desired new workflow step-by-step?
   - Document their answers!

3. **Start a migration plan**
   ```bash
   cd docs
   cp MIGRATION_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md migration-agency-workflow-changes.md
   ```
   - Fill out the Executive Summary
   - Document current behavior (copy from CURRENT_WORKFLOWS.md)
   - Document desired behavior (from faculty conversation)
   - Don't write any code yet!

### Short Term (This Week):

4. **Complete the migration plan**
   - Fill out ALL sections
   - Get team review (at least 2 developers)
   - Get faculty sign-off
   - Estimate timeline

5. **Set up feature flags**
   ```bash
   # Create lib/feature-flags.ts
   # Add environment variables
   # Test toggling on/off
   ```

6. **Create feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/workflow-changes
   ```

### Medium Term (Next 1-2 Weeks):

7. **Implement changes**
   - Database migrations first
   - API endpoints second
   - UI components last
   - Keep old workflow working!

8. **Test thoroughly**
   - Use TESTING_CHECKLIST.md
   - Test with flag OFF (old workflow)
   - Test with flag ON (new workflow)
   - Test all roles and edge cases

9. **Deploy safely**
   - Deploy with flag OFF
   - Enable for testing
   - Gradual rollout
   - Monitor closely

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Strategy

This approach protects you from breaking the system:

### 1. Feature Flags
```typescript
if (FEATURE_FLAGS.NEW_WORKFLOW.enabled) {
  // New workflow code
} else {
  // Old workflow code (keeps working!)
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Toggle on/off instantly
- ‚úÖ Test in production safely
- ‚úÖ Gradual rollout possible
- ‚úÖ Quick rollback if issues

### 2. Parallel Implementation
- Don't delete old code immediately
- New code runs alongside old code
- Both workflows functional during transition
- Remove old code only after new is proven stable

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
- Test old workflow still works (flag OFF)
- Test new workflow works (flag ON)
- Test all user roles
- Test edge cases and errors
- Test performance under load

### 4. Gradual Rollout
- Week 1: Deploy with flag OFF (0% users see changes)
- Week 2: Enable for internal testing (1-2 accounts)
- Week 3: Enable for 10% of users
- Week 4: Enable for 50% of users
- Week 5: Enable for 100% of users
- Week 6+: Remove old code and flag

### 5. Quick Rollback
Every migration plan includes:
- Exact rollback steps
- Database restore procedure
- Code revert instructions
- How to verify rollback successful

## üìä Current System Overview

From analyzing your codebase, here's what I found:

### Key Workflows Identified:

**1. Agency/Site Workflow:**
- Sites can be created and marked ACTIVE immediately
- Learning contracts are OPTIONAL (this might be what faculty wants to change)
- Agencies can submit learning contracts which auto-create supervisors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue: Students can see sites without completed learning contracts

**2. Supervisor Workflow:**
- **Path A:** Faculty create supervisors directly (instant approval)
- **Path B:** Students request new supervisors (pending approval)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue: No email notification system for supervisor credentials

**3. Student Placement Workflow:**
- Student requests placement ‚Üí PENDING
- Student uploads cell phone policy (required)
- Faculty approves ‚Üí APPROVED_PENDING_CHECKLIST
- Faculty activates ‚Üí ACTIVE
- Student logs hours, evaluations, etc.

**4. Timesheet Approval:**
- Student submits ‚Üí PENDING_SUPERVISOR
- Supervisor approves ‚Üí PENDING_FACULTY
- Faculty approves ‚Üí APPROVED (locked)

**5. Evaluation Workflow:**
- Faculty sends evaluation
- Student and supervisor complete independently
- Both must lock before seeing each other's answers

### Current Issues Found:

1. üî¥ **No email system** - Critical communications only in console logs
2. üî¥ **Students see unapproved sites** - No approval gate for agencies
3. üü° **Learning contracts optional** - Sites can be used without detailed vetting
4. üü° **No supervisor vetting** - Faculty can create supervisors without approval process
5. üü° **Limited rollback support** - Hard to undo some operations

These issues are likely what faculty wants you to address!

## üí° Recommended First Migration

Based on common workflow concerns, I recommend starting with:

### **Migration: Require Learning Contract Approval Before Student Access**

**Why start here:**
- Addresses a critical gap (students seeing unapproved sites)
- Relatively contained change
- Builds foundation for future improvements
- Demonstrates the safe migration process

**What it would change:**
1. Sites marked ACTIVE but without learning contracts ‚Üí not visible to students
2. Only sites with APPROVED learning contracts ‚Üí visible to students
3. Faculty must explicitly approve sites after contract review
4. Clear workflow: Create Site ‚Üí Send Contract ‚Üí Agency Completes ‚Üí Faculty Reviews ‚Üí Site Available

**How to approach:**
1. Read `docs/CURRENT_WORKFLOWS.md` - Agency/Site section
2. Copy `docs/MIGRATION_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` ‚Üí `docs/migration-require-learning-contracts.md`
3. Fill out the plan completely
4. Get faculty to confirm this is what they want
5. Implement with feature flags
6. Test using `docs/TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`
7. Deploy gradually

## üìû Questions to Ask Faculty

When you meet with faculty, ask:

### About Agency Workflow:
1. Should learning contracts be REQUIRED or optional?
2. Should students see agencies before learning contracts are approved?
3. Who should approve agencies? (Faculty only? Admin? Specific people?)
4. What happens to existing agencies without contracts?
5. Can agencies be used immediately or must wait for approval?

### About Supervisor Workflow:
1. Should all supervisors require approval (even when faculty creates them)?
2. What qualifications must supervisors have?
3. How should supervisors receive their credentials?
4. Can students suggest supervisors or only faculty?
5. What happens if a supervisor is rejected?

### About Placement Workflow:
1. Are there additional approval steps needed?
2. Should supervisors be assigned before or after placement approval?
3. What documents are truly required vs optional?
4. Can students resubmit if declined?
5. Any new status steps needed?

### General:
1. What's the biggest pain point right now?
2. What breaks most often?
3. What takes too long?
4. What's confusing for users?
5. Priority order for changes?

## üéì Key Principles

Remember these principles as you work:

1. **Document First, Code Second**
   - Planning prevents problems
   - Documentation saves future you

2. **Keep Old Code Working**
   - Feature flags let you toggle
   - Never break existing functionality

3. **Test Everything**
   - Old workflow with flag OFF
   - New workflow with flag ON
   - All roles, all edge cases

4. **Deploy Gradually**
   - Start with 0% (flag OFF)
   - Increase slowly (10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%)
   - Monitor at each stage

5. **Always Have a Rollback Plan**
   - Test rollback BEFORE deploying
   - Document exact steps
   - Know how to recover quickly

6. **Communicate Often**
   - Keep team informed
   - Keep faculty updated
   - Notify users of changes
